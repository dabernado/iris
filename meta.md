- how to implement dynamic function dispatch
  - special `READ/WRITE` channel for type checking + executing functions
    - system may choose to disable and remove ability to execute live code
    - requires a type checker to be implemented in VM/hardware

- how to fix EXPF/COLF?
  - needs some kind of type token to compare actual values when unifying
  - introduce `type` primitive into type system?
    - could also be useful for defining functions
    - does it necessarily need to be a primitive type though?
  - or put type info into fraction type?
    - arg in bytecode must still be polymorphic, even if it is a fraction
- how to implement packed inductives?
  - each inductive contains a field indicating the size of each datum
    - size 1 (nat, unit)
    - size 2 (product, sum(nat))
    - size 3 (sum(product))
    - size n (inductive); equivalent to 1 (each cell is a pointer to inductive)
  - could datum size be encoded in `FOLD/UNFOLD` ops?
- should we implement access paths at IRIS layer?
  - IRIS access path = inductive of (fst/snd + sum + index) tokens at each step
  - useful for replacing pointer to current data type
  - access path = type token?
    - can only be as such if root type is known, which is constantly changing
    - add field to IRIS machine for holding/manipulating type info?
  - add ops for access paths?
- how to implement interaction?
  - add arrows to wrap READ/WRITE?
    - arrow call context?
    - or should it be in sive runtime?
      - has potential to break pure reversible type checking in IRIS
  - async/await for IO operations?
  - `READ/WRITE` as delimited continuations?
    - negative types give concise definition
  - static interaction vs dynamic interaction
    - static interaction = interaction with channel id as constant
    - dynamic interaction = interaction with channel id as op argument
      - capabilities?
  - interaction channels (standardized "IRIS Interactive System Interface"?)
    - 0: open/close new channels
    - 1: delete data (potentially irreversible)
    - 2: verify and/or execute bytecode
    - 3: storage I/O
    - 4: console I/O
    - 5: network I/O

TODO:
- reimplement EXPF/COLF
- optimize op fetch
