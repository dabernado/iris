## Background
### (Meta)Physics of computing
- all physical processes are reversible due to conservation of energy/matter
    - evald ilyenkov quote about reversibility of material dialectics
- information is fundamentally material
    - every material object contains information which describes it
    - and vice versa, information can only be represented by matter
- matter/information are two emergent properties of the same thing
    - cue spinoza
- key takeaway: information processing follows the same rules as physics, whether we like it or not

### The existing paradigm
- computers as they exist today erase information willy nilly
    - in digital computers, bits are released as heat loss when erased
- computation is theorized as a linear process
    - [diagram on whiteboard] restricts exploration of computational space to only one direction
- the result is a very limited and inefficient practice of computation
    - no formal way to deal with change and equivalence in data
    - insecure; ignored data can be exploited by hackers
    - inefficient; energy inputs are wasted

## What is RC and why is it important?
### What it is 
- reversible computation is computing that can run forwards and backwards
    - this is possible because revesible computing conserves information
- RC doesn't make information erasure impossible: it just makes it explicit
    - lends itself better to security analysis
- the result is computation done with (theoretically) zero energy requirements
    - not possible in actuality; see perpetual motion machine problem
    - but still orders of magnitudes more power efficient than regular computing

## Further implications of RC and the search for new intelligence(s)
- how do we make sense of the ever-growing canon of psychological, natural and computational intelligences?
    - artificial intelligence

### Univalent logic vs traditional logic

### Perception of time
