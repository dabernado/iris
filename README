==== IRIS ====

"IRIS" (Isomorphic Reduced Instruction Set) is a r-Turing complete, fully reversible instruction set and assembly language. It defines a small set of simple, yet highly expressive reversible computing primitives which can be used to define logically reversible programs.

"Iris" is a virtual machine which implements IRIS on top of irreversible hardware. It is designed to run reversible programs in an orthogonal, efficient and secure, yet minimal runtime.

This project is currently in its very early stages. Right now, we are working on expanding the set of primitives that Iris supports. Planned features include:

- Multithreading support
- A reversible IRIS self-assembler, which can easily decompile IRIS bytecode back into assembly
- Support for linking C libraries as "faux-reversible" functions, via orthogonal persistence of intermediate values
