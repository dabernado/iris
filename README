==== IRIS ====

"IRIS" (Isomorphic Reduced Instruction Set) is a fully reversible 64-bit instruction set and assembly language. It defines a set of just 28 r-Turing complete computing primitives which can be used to define logically reversible programs.

"Iris" is a virtual machine which implements IRIS on top of irreversible hardware. It is designed to run reversible programs in an orthogonal, efficient and correct, yet minimal runtime.

This project is currently in its very early stages. Right now, we are working on expanding the set of primitives that Iris supports. Planned features include:

- Multithreading support
- JIT compilation support
- A reversible IRIS self-assembler, which can easily decompile IRIS bytecode back into assembly
- Support for linking external irreversible assembly routines as
  "faux-reversible" functions, via orthogonal persistence of intermediate values
